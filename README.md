# EEG Real-Time Signal Analysis Pipeline 🧠

## 🚀 Project Overview
An AI-powered system designed to analyze complex **Time-Series Data** (EEG Brain Signals) in real-time. This project was developed for the **Education Innovation Hackathon**, where we built a solution to classify user mental states and personalize learning pathways.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* **Signal Processing:** Applied Bandpass filters (8-30 Hz) to isolate Alpha and Beta waves from raw EEG streams.
* **Machine Learning:** Trained classifiers using **Scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** to detect concentration patterns.
* **Optimization:** Engineered the pipeline to handle high-frequency data with minimal latency for real-time applications.

## 🌟 Key Features
- [x] Real-time Data Ingestion
- [x] Noise Filtering & Artifact Removal
- [x] Personalized Recommendation Logic
